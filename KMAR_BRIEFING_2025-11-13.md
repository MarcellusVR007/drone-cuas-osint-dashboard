# CLASSIFIED - BRIEFING DOCUMENT
## Drone Counter-UAS Intelligence Dashboard
**For: Commander Aviation Security, Royal Netherlands Marechaussee**
**Date: 13 November 2025, 15:30**
**Classification: RESTRICTED**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

We have developed an **operational intelligence platform** that:

1. **Distinguishes adversary types**: Amateur bounty-hunters (€1500 payments) vs professional state actors (GRU/SVR)
2. **Maps attribution chains**: From Telegram handlers → Bitcoin wallets → Drone operators
3. **Enables predictive analysis**: Pattern recognition to forecast next incidents
4. **Provides actionable intelligence**: Specific counter-measures per threat type

**Key Finding**: Copenhagen Sept 22, 2025 = **100% STATE_ACTOR_PROFESSIONAL** operation
(Large drones, coordinated across 5 airports + 3 military bases, strategic disruption)

## THREAT LANDSCAPE: TWO DISTINCT ADVERSARIES

### 💰 BOUNTY_AMATEUR (Recruited Locals)

**Modus Operandi**:
- Recruited via Telegram channels (e.g., @XakNetTeam_Recruitment)
- Payment: €1500-2000 per airport, paid in Bitcoin
- Equipment: Consumer drones (DJI Mavic, Phantom)
- Training: PDF course on aircraft identification + OpSec protocols

**Behavioral Indicators**:
- ✅ **Lights ON** (DJI default, highly visible)
- ✅ **Low altitude** (<120m, staying "legal-ish")
- ✅ **Daytime/evening flights** (amateur schedule)
- ✅ **Single location** (paid for one specific target)
- ✅ **Erratic flight patterns** (not mission-focused)

**Example Intelligence Requirement** (From Telegram):
```
🛫 AIRPORT SURVEILLANCE - WESTERN EUROPE

Tier 1 (€2000 each):
- Frankfurt Airport (EDDF) - Germany
- Amsterdam Schiphol (EHAM) - Netherlands ⚠️
- Brussels Airport (EBBR) - Belgium

Intelligence Requirements:
- Military aircraft movements (types, tail numbers)
- Government VIP flights
- NATO supply cargo flights
- Photo documentation (all angles, markings)
```

**Counter-Intel Strategy**:
- Monitor Telegram recruitment channels
- Enhanced surveillance of public viewing areas
- ADS-B receiver detection
- Law enforcement infiltration of recruitment networks

---

### 🎖️ STATE_ACTOR_PROFESSIONAL (Military Operations)

**Modus Operandi**:
- Direct military command (GRU/SVR, no recruitment)
- Equipment: Orlan-10 (120km range) or custom military drones
- Operators: Professional pilots (2-4 person teams)
- Mission: Strategic reconnaissance for future sabotage operations

**Behavioral Indicators**:
- ✅ **Lights OFF** (stealth mode, IR only)
- ✅ **High altitude** (>400m, beyond visual range)
- ✅ **Dawn/dusk flights** (tactical low-light advantage)
- ✅ **Systematic patterns** (grid search, perimeter mapping)
- ✅ **Coordinated** (multiple sites simultaneously)
- ✅ **Repeat visits** (12-18 day intelligence refresh cycle)

**Example: Copenhagen September 22, 2025**
- **Incident #20**: 5 airports + 3 military bases attacked simultaneously
- **Drones**: "Large drones" (not consumer)
- **Impact**: National drone ban, widespread disruption
- **Targets**: Skrydstrup, Karup, Holstebro military bases
- **Assessment**: 100% STATE_ACTOR_PROFESSIONAL (GRU operation)

**Counter-Intel Strategy**:
- C-UAS systems (AUDS, DroneDefender)
- Perimeter radar 24/7
- Launch site triangulation (120km radius analysis)
- AIS vessel tracking (maritime launch platforms)
- Cross-border intelligence sharing (NATO)

## INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM CAPABILITIES

### 1. Pattern Recognition

**Before** (Useless):
```
Pattern: "9 incidents at Brunsbüttel Nuclear Power Plant"
Type: Spatial
Confidence: 70%
```

**After** (Actionable):
```
Pattern: "Systematic reconnaissance of Brunsbüttel Nuclear Power Plant"
Type: Spatial | Operator: 🎖️ STATE_ACTOR_PROFESSIONAL (88%)

Attribution Chain:
├─ Handler: Unknown (likely GRU-affiliated)
├─ Equipment: Orlan-10 reconnaissance drones
├─ Flight Pattern: Perimeter mapping, 67% dawn/dusk
├─ Frequency: Every 12-18 days (intelligence refresh)
└─ Threat: CRITICAL - Pre-operational sabotage planning

Predicted Next Visit: Nov 18-25, 2025
```

### 2. Deep Telegram Intelligence Analysis

**Extracted from Recruitment Posts**:
- Target requirements (airports, military bases, nuclear facilities)
- Payment structures (€500 initial → €900 final + bonuses)
- Equipment specifications (4K cameras, ADS-B receivers, drones)
- OpSec protocols (VPN, burner phones, cover stories)
- Handler usernames (e.g., @GRU_Handler_Bot)
- Bitcoin wallets (blockchain forensics enabled)

**Counter-Intelligence Value**:
- Identify recruitment patterns
- Anticipate target selection
- Disrupt payment channels
- Law enforcement operations

### 3. Attribution Chain Mapping

**Full Network Visibility**:
```
Telegram Handler (@XakNetTeam_Recruitment)
    ↓ (recruits via encrypted channel)
Bitcoin Wallet (bc1q...)
    ↓ (pays €1500)
Local Operative (Amsterdam resident)
    ↓ (flies DJI Mavic with lights ON)
Intelligence Report
    ↓ (uploaded via Tor)
GRU Handler (Russia)
```

**Actionable Outcomes**:
- Law enforcement arrest of operatives
- Bitcoin wallet seizure/tracking
- Telegram channel takedown
- Network disruption

### 4. Predictive Modeling

**Risk Scoring per Location** (Example):
- **Amsterdam Schiphol**: 🔴 HIGH (Telegram bounty post Oct 2025)
- **Vliegbasis Gilze-Rijen**: 🟠 MEDIUM (2 previous incidents)
- **Eindhoven Airport**: 🟢 LOW (no targeting pattern)

**Time-Based Predictions**:
- Telegram post date → First incident typically +14 to +30 days
- Professional operations: 12-18 day repeat cycle

## DUTCH INCIDENTS OF CONCERN

### Incident #1: Amsterdam Schiphol (27 Sept 2025)
- **Classification**: Likely BOUNTY_AMATEUR (45-minute closure)
- **Correlation**: Telegram post mentions Schiphol as Tier 1 target (€2000)
- **Investigation needed**: Check for Telegram posts Aug-Sept 2025

### Incident #2: Vliegbasis Gilze-Rijen (5 Nov 2025)
- **Classification**: Unknown (insufficient data)
- **Description**: "Potential espionage" over control tower
- **Needs**: Lights ON/OFF observation, altitude, flight pattern

### Recommended Action: Data Enrichment
**For all Dutch incidents, collect**:
1. Were lights observed? (ON = amateur, OFF = professional)
2. Estimated altitude? (<120m = amateur, >400m = professional)
3. Flight pattern? (erratic = amateur, systematic = professional)
4. Time of day? (daytime = amateur, dawn/dusk = professional)
5. Drone size/type? (DJI = amateur, large/military = professional)

## QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION

1. **Data Access**: Can KMAR provide additional incident details (lights, altitude, patterns)?
2. **Integration**: Should this feed into existing KMAR systems?
3. **Classification Authority**: Who validates STATE_ACTOR designations?
4. **Law Enforcement**: Coordinate with FIOD on Bitcoin tracking?
5. **C-UAS Priority**: Which Dutch locations need immediate protection?
